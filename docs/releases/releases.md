## 0.14.0 <small>Nov 11, 2024</small> { id="0.14.0" }

The main changes in this release are:

This release has undergone a major refactoring to improve the performance of the library. Visit the [migration guide](../user_guides/migration-guide.html) section for more information.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> Window features can be added to the training matrix using the `window_features` argument in all forecasters. You can use the <code>[RollingFeatures]</code> class to create these features or create your own object. [Create window and custom features](../user_guides/window-features-and-custom-features.html).

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> <code>[model_selection]</code> functions now have a new argument `cv`. This argument expect an object of type <code>[TimeSeriesFold]</code> ([backtesting](../user_guides/backtesting.html)) or <code>[OneStepAheadFold]</code> which allows to define the validation strategy using the arguments `initial_train_size`, `steps`, `gap`, `refit`, `fixed_train_size`, `skip_folds` and `allow_incomplete_folds`.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> Hyperparameter search now allows to follow a [one-step-ahead validation strategy](../user_guides/hyperparameter-tuning-and-lags-selection.html#one-step-ahead-validation) using a <code>[OneStepAheadFold]</code> as `cv` argument in the <code>[model_selection]</code> functions.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-enhancement">Enhancement</span> Refactor the prediction process in <code>[ForecasterRecursiveMultiSeries]</code> to improve performance when predicting multiple series.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-enhancement">Enhancement</span> The bootstrapping process in the `predict_bootstrapping` method of all forecasters has been optimized to improve performance. This may result in slightly different results when using the same seed as in previous versions.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-enhancement">Enhancement</span> Exogenous variables can be added to the training matrix if they do not contain the first window size observations. This is useful when exogenous variables are not available in early historical data. Visit the [exogenous variables](../user_guides/exogenous-variables.html#handling-missing-exogenous-data-in-initial-training-periods) section for more information.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-api-change">API Change</span> Package structure has been changed to improve code organization. The forecasters have been grouped into the `recursive`, `direct` amd `deep_learning` modules. Visit the [migration guide](../user_guides/migration-guide.html) section for more information.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-api-change">API Change</span> <code>[ForecasterAutoregCustom]</code> has been deprecated. [Window features](../user_guides/window-features-and-custom-features.html) can be added using the `window_features` argument in the <code>[ForecasterRecursive]</code>.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-api-change">API Change</span> Refactor the `set_out_sample_residuals` method in all forecasters, it now expects `y_true` and `y_pred` as arguments instead of `residuals`. This method is used to store the residuals of the out-of-sample predictions.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-api-change">API Change</span> The `pmdarima.ARIMA` regressor is no longer supported by the <code>[ForecasterSarimax]</code>. You can use the skforecast <code>[Sarimax]</code> model or, to continue using it, use skforecast 0.13.0 or lower.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-danger">Fix</span> Fixed a bug where the `create_predict_X` method in recursive Forecasters did not correctly generate the matrix correctly when using transformations and/or differentiations


**Added**

+ Added `numba>=0.59` as hard dependency.

+ Added `window_features` argument to all forecasters. This argument allows the user to add window features to the training matrix. See <code>[RollingFeatures]</code>.

+ Hyperparameter search now allows to follow a one-step-ahead validation strategy using a <code>[OneStepAheadFold]</code> as `cv` argument in the <code>[model_selection]</code> functions.

+ Differentiation has been extended to all forecasters. The `differentiation` argument has been added to all forecasters to model the n-order differentiated time series.

+ Create `transform_numpy` function in the <code>[utils]</code> module to carry out the transformation of the modeled time series and exogenous variables as numpy arrays.

+ `random_state` argument in the `fit` method of <code>[ForecasterRecursive]</code> to set a seed for the random generator so that the stored sample residuals are always deterministic.

+ New private method `_train_test_split_one_step_ahead` in all forecasters.

+ New private function `_calculate_metrics_one_step_ahead` to <code>[model_selection]</code> module to calculate the metrics when predicting one step ahead.

+ The `steps` argument in the predict method of the <code>[ForecasterRecursive]</code> can now be a str or a pandas datetime. If so, the method will predict up to the specified date. (contribution by [@imMoya](https://github.com/imMoya) [#811](https://github.com/skforecast/skforecast/pull/811)).

+ Exogenous variables can be added to the training matrix if they do not contain the first window size observations. This is useful when exogenous variables are not available in early historical data.

+ Added support for different activation functions in the <code>[create_and_compile_model]</code> function. (contribution by [@pablorodriper](https://github.com/pablorodriper) [#824](https://github.com/skforecast/skforecast/pull/824)).


**Changed**

+ <code>[ForecasterAutoregCustom]</code> has been deprecated. Window features can be added using the `window_features` argument in the <code>[ForecasterRecursive]</code>.

+ Refactor `recursive_predict` in <code>[ForecasterRecursiveMultiSeries]</code> to predict all series at once and include option of adding residuals. This improves performance when predicting multiple series.

+ Refactor `predict_bootstrapping` in all Forecasters. The bootstrapping process has been optimized to improve performance. This may result in slightly different results when using the same seed as in previous versions.

+ Change the default value of `encoding` to `ordinal` in <code>[ForecasterRecursiveMultiSeries]</code>. This will avoid conflicts if the regressor does not support categorical variables by default.

+ Removed argument `engine` from <code>[bayesian_search_forecaster]</code> and <code>[bayesian_search_forecaster_multiseries]</code>.

+ The `pmdarima.ARIMA` regressor is no longer supported by the <code>[ForecasterSarimax]</code>. You can use the skforecast <code>[Sarimax]</code> model or, to continue using it, use skforecast 0.13.0 or lower.

+ `initialize_lags` in <code>[utils]</code> now returns the maximum lag, `max_lag`.

+ Removed attribute `window_size_diff` from all Forecasters. The window size extended by the order of differentiation is now calculated on `window_size`.

+ `lags` can be `None` when initializing any Forecaster that includes window features.

+ <code>[model_selection]</code> module has been divided internally into different modules to improve code organization (`_validation`, `_search`, `_split`).

+ Functions from `model_selection_multiseries` and `model_selection_sarimax` modules have been moved to the <code>[model_selection]</code> module.

+ Added <code>[feature_selection]</code> module. The functions <code>[select_features]</code> and <code>[select_features_multiseries]</code> have been moved to this module.

+ The functions <code>[select_features]</code> and <code>[select_features_multiseries]</code> now have 3 returns: `selected_lags`, `selected_window_features` and `selected_exog`.

+ Refactor the `set_out_sample_residuals` method in all forecasters, it now expects `y_true` and `y_pred` as arguments instead of `residuals`.

## 0.13.0 <small>Aug 01, 2024</small> { id="0.13.0" }

The main changes in this release are:

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> Global Forecasters <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries]</code> and <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom]</code> are able to [predict series not seen during training](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/independent-multi-time-series-forecasting.html#forecasting-unknown-series). This is useful when the user wants to predict a new series that was not included in the training data.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> `encoding` can be set to `None` in Global Forecasters <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries]</code> and <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom]</code>. This option does [not add the encoded series ids](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/independent-multi-time-series-forecasting#series-encoding-in-multi-series) to the regressor training matrix.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> New `create_predict_X` method in all recursive and direct Forecasters to allow the user to inspect the matrix passed to the predict method of the regressor.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> New module <code>[metrics]</code> with functions to calculate metrics for time series forecasting such as <code>[mean_absolute_scaled_error]</code> and <code>[root_mean_squared_scaled_error]</code>. Visit [Time Series Forecasting Metrics](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/metrics.html) for more information.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> New argument `add_aggregated_metric` in <code>[backtesting_forecaster_multiseries]</code> to include, in addition to the metrics for each level, the aggregated metric of all levels using the average (arithmetic mean), weighted average (weighted by the number of predicted values of each level) or pooling (the values of all levels are pooled and then the metric is calculated).

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> New argument `skip_folds` in <code>[model_selection]</code> and <code>[model_selection_multiseries]</code> functions. It allows the user to [skip some folds during backtesting](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/backtesting#backtesting-with-skip-folds), which can be useful to speed up the backtesting process and thus the hyperparameter search.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-api-change">API Change</span> backtesting procedures now pass the training series to the metric functions so it can be used to calculate metrics that depend on the training series.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-api-change">API Change</span> Changed the default value of the `transformer_series` argument to `None` in the Global Forecasters <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries]</code> and <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom]</code>. In most cases, tree-based models are used as regressors in these forecasters, so no transformation is applied by default as it is not necessary.

**Added**

+ Support for `python 3.12`.

+ `keras` has been added as an optional dependency, tag deeplearning, to use the <code>[ForecasterRnn]</code>.

+ `PyTorch` backend for the <code>[ForecasterRnn]</code>.

+ New `create_predict_X` method in all recursive and direct Forecasters to allow the user to inspect the matrix passed to the predict method of the regressor.

+ New `_create_predict_inputs` method in all Forecasters to unify the inputs of the predict methods.

+ New plot function <code>[plot_prediction_intervals]</code> in the <code>[plot]</code> module to plot predicted intervals.

+ New module <code>[metrics]</code> with functions to calculate metrics for time series forecasting such as `mean_absolute_scaled_error` and `root_mean_squared_scaled_error`.

+ New argument `skip_folds` in <code>[model_selection]</code> and <code>[model_selection_multiseries]</code> functions. It allows the user to skip some folds during backtesting, which can be useful to speed up the backtesting process and thus the hyperparameter search.

+ New function <code>[plot_prediction_intervals]</code> in module <code>[plot]</code>.

+ Global Forecasters <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries]</code> and <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom]</code> are able to predict series not seen during training. This is useful when the user wants to predict a new series that was not included in the training data.

+ `encoding` can be set to `None` in Global Forecasters <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries]</code> and <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom]</code>. This option does not add the encoded series ids to the regressor training matrix.

+ New argument `add_aggregated_metric` in <code>[backtesting_forecaster_multiseries]</code> to include, in addition to the metrics for each level, the aggregated metric of all levels using the average (arithmetic mean), weighted average (weighted by the number of predicted values of each level) or pooling (the values of all levels are pooled and then the metric is calculated).

+ New argument `aggregate_metric` in <code>[grid_search_forecaster_multiseries]</code>, <code>[random_search_forecaster_multiseries]</code> and <code>[bayesian_search_forecaster_multiseries]</code> to select the aggregation method used to combine the metric(s) of all levels during the hyperparameter search. The available methods are: mean (arithmetic mean), weighted (weighted by the number of predicted values of each level) and pool (the values of all levels are pooled and then the metric is calculated). If more than one metric and/or aggregation method is used, all are reported in the results, but the first of each is used to select the best model.

+ New class <code>[DateTimeFeatureTransformer]</code> and function <code>[create_datetime_features]</code> in the <code>[preprocessing]</code> module to create datetime and calendar features from a datetime index.

**Changed**

+ Deprecated `python 3.8` compatibility.

+ Update [project dependencies](https://skforecast.org/latest/quick-start/how-to-install).

+ Change default value of `n_bins` when initializing <code>[ForecasterAutoreg]</code> from 15 to 10.

+ Refactor `_recursive_predict` in all recursive forecasters.

+ Change default value of `transformer_series` when initializing <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries]</code> and <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom]</code> from `StandardScaler()` to `None`.

+ Function `_get_metric` moved from <code>[model_selection]</code> to <code>[metrics]</code>.

+ Change information message when `verbose` is `True` in <code>[backtesting_forecaster]</code> and <code>[backtesting_forecaster_multiseries]</code>.

+ `select_n_jobs_backtesting` and `select_n_jobs_fit` in <code>[utils]</code> return `n_jobs = 1` if regressor is `LGBMRegressor`. This is because `lightgbm` is highly optimized for gradient boosting and parallelizes operations at a very fine-grained level, making additional parallelization unnecessary and potentially harmful due to resource contention.

+ `metric_values` returned by <code>[backtesting_forecaster]</code> and <code>[backtesting_sarimax]</code> is a `pandas DataFrame` with one column per metric instead of a `list`.

**Fixed**

+ Bug fix in <code>[backtesting_forecaster_multiseries]</code> using a <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries]</code> or <code>[ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom]</code> that includes differentiation.


## 0.12.1 <small>May 20, 2024</small> { id="0.12.1" }

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> Multiseries forecaster (Global Models) can be trained using [series of different lengths and with different exogenous variables](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/multi-series-with-different-length-and-different_exog) per series.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> New functionality to [select features](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/feature-selection) using scikit-learn selectors ([`select_features`](https://skforecast.org/latest/api/model_selection#skforecast.model_selection.model_selection.select_features) and [`select_features_multiseries`](https://skforecast.org/0.12.0/api/model_selection_multiseries#skforecast.model_selection_multiseries.model_selection_multiseries.select_features_multiseries)).

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> Added new forecaster [`ForecasterRnn`](https://skforecast.org/latest/api/forecasterrnn) to create forecasting models based on [deep learning](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/forecasting-with-deep-learning-rnn-lstm) (RNN and LSTM).

+ <span class="badge text-bg-feature">Feature</span> New method to [predict intervals conditioned on the range of the predicted values](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/probabilistic-forecasting#intervals-conditioned-on-predicted-values-binned-residuals). This is can help to improve the interval coverage when the residuals are not homoscedastic ([`ForecasterAutoreg`](https://skforecast.org/0.12.0/api/forecasterautoreg)).

+ <span class="badge text-bg-enhancement">Enhancement</span> [Bayesian hyperparameter search](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/independent-multi-time-series-forecasting#hyperparameter-tuning-and-lags-selection-multi-series) is now available for all multiseries forecasters using `optuna` as the search engine.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-enhancement">Enhancement</span> All Recursive Forecasters are now able to [differentiate the time series](https://skforecast.org/latest/user_guides/time-series-differentiation) before modeling it.

+ <span class="badge text-bg-api-change">API Change</span> Changed the default value of the `transformer_series` argument to use a `StandardScaler()` in the Global Forecasters ([`ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries`](https://skforecast.org/0.12.0/api/forecastermultiseries), [`ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom`](https://skforecast.org/0.12.0/api/forecastermultiseriescustom) and [`ForecasterAutoregMultiVariate`](https://skforecast.org/0.12.0/api/forecastermultivariate)).

**Added**

+ Added `bayesian_search_forecaster_multiseries` function to `model_selection_multiseries` module. This function performs a Bayesian hyperparameter search for the `ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries`, `ForecasterAutoregMultiSeriesCustom`, and `ForecasterAutoregMultiVariate` using `optuna` as the search engine.

+ `ForecasterAutoregMultiVariate` allows to include None when lags is a dict so that a series does not participate in the construction of X_train.

+ The `output_file` argument has been added to the hyperparameter search functions in the `model_selection`, `model_selection_multiseries` and `model_selection_sarimax` modules to save the results of the hyperparameter search in a tab-separated values (TSV) file.
