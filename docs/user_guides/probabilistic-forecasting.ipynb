    "# Probabilistic forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to anticipate future values, most forecasting models try to predict what will be the most likely value. This is called point-forecasting. Although knowing in advance the expected value of a time series is useful in almost every business case, this kind of prediction does not provide any information about the confidence of the model nor the prediction uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic forecasting, as opposed to point-forecasting, is a family of techniques that allow for predicting the expected distribution of the outcome instead of a single future value. This type of forecasting provides much rich information since it allows for creating prediction intervals, the range of likely values where the true value may fall. More formally, a prediction interval defines the interval within which the true value of the response variable is expected to be found with a given probability.\n",

    "## Bootstrapped residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is a statistical technique that allows for estimating the distribution of a statistic by resampling the data with replacement. In the context of forecasting, bootstrapping the residuals of a model allows for estimating the distribution of the errors, which can be used to create prediction intervals. Four methods are available in Skforecast for bootstrapping the residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `predict_bootstrapping`: this method generates multiple forecasting predictions through a bootstrapping process. By sampling from a collection of past observed errors (the residuals), each bootstrapping iteration generates a different set of predictions. The output is a `pandas DataFrame` with one row for each predicted step and one column for each bootstrapping iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `predict_interval(method='bootstrapping')`: this method estimates quantile prediction intervals using the values generated with `predict_bootstrapping`.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `predict_quantiles`: this method estimates a list of quantile predictions using the values generated with `predict_bootstrapping`.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `predict_dist`: this method fits a parametric distribution using the values generated with `predict_bootstrapping`. Any of the continuous distributions available in [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#continuous-distributions) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four methods can use in-sample residuals (default) or out-sample residuals. In both cases, the residuals can be conditioned on the predicted value to try to account for the existence of a correlation between the predicted values and the residuals.\n",

    "## Quantile regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantile regression is a technique for estimating the conditional quantiles of a response variable. By combining the predictions of two quantile regressors, an interval can be constructed, where each model estimates one of the interval’s boundaries. For example, models trained for $Q = 0.1$ and $Q = 0.9$ produce an 80% prediction interval ($90\\% - 10\\% = 80\\%$).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a machine learning algorithm capable of modeling quantiles is used as the `regressor` in a forecaster, the `predict` method will return predictions for a specified quantile. By creating two forecasters, each configured with a different quantile, their predictions can be combined to generate a prediction interval.\n",

    "## Conformal prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conformal prediction is a framework for constructing prediction intervals that are valid with respect to the coverage probability. The interval is created by combining the predictions of a point-forecasting model with its residuals. These residuals help estimate the width of the prediction interval, which is then added to the point forecast. Skforecast implements Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) through the `predict_interval(method='conformal')` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conformal methods can also calibrate prediction intervals generated by other techniques, such as quantile regression or bootstrapped residuals. In this case, the conformal method adjusts the prediction intervals to ensure they remain valid with respect to the coverage probability. Skforecast provides this functionality through the `ConformalInterval` transformer.\n",

    "## Which Method to Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no definitive answer to this question, as the resulting coverage may vary depending on the dataset and regressor. However, some general guidelines can be followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootstrapped residuals**: This method achieves good results in most cases, especially when using residuals conditioned on the predicted value (`use_binned_residuals = True`). However, it is computationally expensive, particularly when using a large number of bootstrapping iterations, and may not scale well to large datasets or multiple time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantile regression**: A suitable choice when the regressor is capable of modeling quantiles. However, two forecasters must be trained—one for each quantile—which can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conformal Prediction**: Similar results to bootstrapping, but more computationally efficient (fast).\n",
    "\n",
    "None of these methods guarantee coverage probability for multi-step predictions. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to validate the empirical coverage obtained with the chosen method. If the coverage is not satisfactory, the prediction intervals can be calibrated using the `ConformalInterval` transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For bootstrapped and conformal methods, it is recommended to use out-sample residuals (known as calibration residuals in conformal literature) as they provide a more realistic estimate of the prediction uncertainty. If in-sample residuals are used, the prediction intervals may be too narrow, resulting in low coverage."
