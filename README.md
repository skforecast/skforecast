# About The Project

**Skforecast** is a Python library for time series forecasting using machine learning models. It works with any regressor compatible with the scikit-learn API, including popular options like LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Keras, and many others.

### Why use skforecast?

Skforecast simplifies time series forecasting with machine learning by providing:

- :jigsaw: **Seamless integration** with any scikit-learn compatible regressor (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.).
- :repeat: **Flexible workflows** that allow for both single and multi-series forecasting.
- :hammer_and_wrench: **Comprehensive tools** for feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and more.
- :building_construction: **Production-ready models** with interpretability and validation methods for backtesting and realistic performance evaluation.

Whether you're building quick prototypes or deploying models in production, skforecast ensures a fast, reliable, and scalable experience.

# Forecasters

A **Forecaster** object in the skforecast library is a comprehensive container that provides essential functionality and methods for training a forecasting model and generating predictions for future points in time.

The **skforecast** library offers a variety of forecaster types, each tailored to specific requirements such as single or multiple time series, direct or recursive strategies, or custom predictors. Regardless of the specific forecaster type, all instances share the same API.

| Forecaster | Single series | Multiple series | Recursive strategy | Direct strategy | Probabilistic prediction | Time series differentiation | Exogenous features | Window features |
