        Please include a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) so users can reproduce the error when running it. Be as succinct as possible, and do not depend on external data files.

        Being able to copy and paste code to reproduce an error is extremely helpful for us, and the issue will take longer to resolve if one is not included. If including a code example is not applicable for your report, enter "N/A" in the box.

        If the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public [gist](https://gist.github.com) and link it in the issue.
